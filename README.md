# Eventery

A tiny publish-subscribe library for JavaScript, specifically tailored for use in games:

- Instantiate event objects with typed arguments.
- Supports events with zero, one, or multiple typed arguments; no need to create extra payload objects for events with multiple arguments.
- Events support synchronous and asynchronous publishing.
- Zero dependencies!

## Usage

```ts
import { Event } from "eventery";

/* Create an event. You can pass a type to describe the event's
payload arguments. These may optionally be named, like here: */
const event = new Event<[deltaTime: number]>();

/* Create a callback and add it as a subscriber. */
function callback(dt: number) {
  console.log(dt);
}

event.subscribe(callback);

/* Publish an event. The subscribers will be invoked synchronously. */
event.publish(123);

/* Unsubscribe the callback. */
event.unsubscribe(callback);

/* Clear all subscribers. */
event.clear();
```

## Event Payloads

Event payloads are typed using TypeScript's tuple syntax. For example, the following event has a payload with two arguments:

```ts
const event = new Event<[number, number]>();
```

These arguments may optionally be named:

```ts
const event = new Event<[x: number, y: number]>();
```

Payload arguments can be made optional:

```ts
const event = new Event<[dt: number, context?: string]>();
```

They can use the `...` syntax to indicate that the argument is a rest parameter:

```ts
const event = new Event<[context: string, ...deltas: number[]]>();
```
